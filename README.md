# Terminology Server Syndication Standard - DRAFT

**Everything here is currently draft and should not be considered to be agreed as a standard nor should it be implemented yet**

As part of a strategy to move towards wider adoption of healthcare terminology servers which implement the HL7 FHIR Terminology Services, a more effective way of distributing terminology would be from server to server through a syndication feed.

Based on existing work implemented by the [Australian Digital Health Agency](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/specs/v2/conformant-server-apps/syndication-api/syndication-feed/), this feed extends the [Atom Syndication Standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287). It is not specific to SNOMED CT and can be used for any relevant healthcare standard,

The additions here are from SNOMED International and are in the sct namespace, http://snomed.info/syndication/sct-extension/1.0.0, for distributing SNOMED CT content. 

## Details

Example feed can be seen in this repo - [feed-example.xml](feed-example.xml)

The extensions to the specification are as follows:

```
<sct:packageDependency>
     <sct:editionDependency></sct:editionDependency>
     <sct:derivativeDependency></sct:derivativeDependency>
</sct:packageDependency>
```

These are SNOMED CT specific extensions to specify any package dependency for a given release package that are not included in the package itself. Dependencies can be on **editions** or other **derivatives**.

[Edition packages](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/edition) by definition include all their dependencies and therefore do not have a `sct:packageDependency` element.

[Extension packages](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/extension) always depend on other packages' content not included in the extension package and therefore always have a `sct:packageDependency` element.

[Edition packages](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/edition) and [Extension packages](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCGLOSS/extension) can therefore be distinguished by the absence or presence of a `sct:packageDependency` element.

Within a `sct:packageDependency` element
- **sct:editionDependency** states any necessary edition dependency and version using the SNOMED CT URI standard, e.g. `http://snomed.info/sct/900000000000207008/version/20220731`. Where a package is transitively dependent on multiple editions, only the direct non-transitive dependencies should be stated. Downloading packages would complete when there are no further dependencies.
- **sct:derivativeDependency** states any necessary derivative dependency, as they are often published outside of SNOMED CT editions. Similarly, this should also follow the SNOMED CT URI standard for module and version

### Packaging types for extensions and derivatives
The major distinction between extensions and derivatives is that extensions add/modify core components, where derivatives are limited to reference sets providing non-core "bolt on" content.

#### Extensions
For editions, most implementers want a ready to use package rather than parts and assembly instructions. Assembling an edition from an extension package and a base edition is not a trivial exercise, requiring content to be combined and a snapshot calculated based on the [Module Dependency Reference Set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/5.2.4.2+Module+Dependency+Reference+Set).

For this reason *edition packaging is preferred as the primary distribution method extensions*. Extensions may also be provided in extension packaging, however if only one is made availabe edition packaging is preferred.

The rationale for this recommendation is that 
- implementers desiring an extension package are in the minority and more capable of disassembiling an edition package if necessary
- the majority of implementers would prefer a ready to use edition package, and the task of assembling that from an extension and base edition package and calculating a snapshot based on the [Module Dependency Reference Set](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/5.2.4.2+Module+Dependency+Reference+Set) is burdensome.

#### Derivatives
Derivatives are designed to bolt on to an edition, and as such are either "pre-mixed" into an edition package or provided as an extension package.

When provided by themselves, they make most sense provided as an extension package so they can be "bolted onto" a number of different compatible editions. Therefore the *preferred packaging of a derivative is an extension package*.

Note that this preference does not preclude prepackaging one or more derivatives in edition packages where useful.

## Authentication
The standard does not mandate any authentication and this is left to the implementer of the Atom feed provider to implement whatever is needed depending on any terminology product license requirements.

## Use Cases

Syndication of terminologies has a number of use cases. A few examples are:

Automatic distribution of content products by their owners:

- International content products
- National content products
- Regional content products

Automatic import of selected products and dependencies as updates become available:

- Automatic update of existing terminology server instances
  - Browser server containing both published content and daily builds
- Automatic provision of new terminology server instances
  - Autoscaling
